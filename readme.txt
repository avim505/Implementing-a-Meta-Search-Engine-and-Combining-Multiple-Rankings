Welcome to the Read Me file for our project on implementing a meta-search engine and combining multiple rankings for improving web search performance. 
This read me tells how to use the output of the assignment. 


This Read Me file will provide an overview of the project, the implementation details, and the steps to run the code. 
We hope this project provides a useful learning experience and insights into the process of building a meta-search engine.

To use the meta-search engine, follow the steps below:

1. Obtain five ranked passage retrieval result files in the format "output-york07-ga-01.txt".
2. Place these files in the root directory of the project.
3. Run the Python file "MetaSearchGUI.py".
4. The GUI will be launched. Enter the title of the document ID you want to search for.
5. Click the "Search" button to initiate the search.
6. The search results will be displayed in the GUI.

Please note that the meta-search engine requires Python version 3.6 or higher to run.

After following the instructions and running the Python file, we were able to retrieve 1000 ranked files through the GUI. 
By combining the multiple ranking results, we were able to obtain more relevant and accurate results for the search queries.  The improvement in the performance of web search demonstrates the importance of incorporating multiple ranking algorithms in the search process.
